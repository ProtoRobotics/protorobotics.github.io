    <h2>Our Process</h2>
    <p>At Proto, we follow an iterative process to make sure that our product is always improving. We are all about trying new things, making mistakes, and finding what works. It shows, too. In our three years of operation, Proto has made state twice. Additionally, we are 100% open source. We view FTC a learning opportunity first, competition second, so when we see an opportunity to help other teams, we take it.</p>
